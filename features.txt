Features over the MVP:
	Random enemy spawning
	Random enemy movement and speed
	Enemies able to drop magnetic mines that do extra damage
	Variable damage amounts (not just boolean destroyed or not)
	Score based on enemies destroyed
	Gun auto-fire (for those not wanting carpal-tunnel)
	Player ship constrained by screen limits
	A lot of sound effects for every action
	Possibly some other stuff I forgot because I built this by looking at what features needed to be implemented that week, then implemented them in whatever way I thought made sense (e.g. enemy spawning was actually introduced with enemies because I didn't want to manually place them)

Features for the assessment:
	Fully functional main menu that is returned to after each death for infinite replays and pausing
	Several power-ups including different fire modes and health with a timer so they are not overused
	Boss enemies that spawn in every 30 points with unique weapons and movement, as well as a frenzy state caused by the player doing damage

Things that I would have liked to add if I had more time:
	A proper "ship" and "object" class to use for inheritance to reduce duplication of functions and variables
	Modular power-up system using proper objects instead of if-else statements if I didn't lack the time and brain-power (there is a reason I'm not a programmer)
	Better feedback to the player with particle effects, screen shake, flashing, and temporary invincibility
	Improve performance, Im not sure if its a bug with Godot or me but the debug profiler shows the scrolling background image as the only image in memory infinitely so there might be something up with that?
